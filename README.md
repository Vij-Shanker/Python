# Python
**List of Practical on Python**

1	Personalized Greeting Generator* - Write a python code to generate Personalized Greeting.	

2	Calculating Areas of Geometric Figures* - Write a python program to calculate areas of any geometric figures like circle, rectangle and triangle.	

3	Calculating Gross Salary of an Employee*: Write a Python program to calculate the gross salary of an employee. The program should prompt the user for the basic salary (BS) and then compute the dearness allowance (DA) as 70% of BS, the travel allowance (TA) as 30% of BS, and the house rent allowance (HRA) as 10% of BS. Finally, it should calculate the gross salary as the sum of BS, DA, TA, and HRA and display the result.				
4	Exploring Basic Arithmetic Operations in Python*: Write a Python program to explore basic arithmetic operations. The program should prompt the user to enter two numbers and then perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus operations on those numbers. The results of each operation should be displayed to the user.				
5	Task List Manager*: Develop a Python program to manage a task list using lists and tuples, including adding, removing, updating, and sorting tasks.				
6	Student Enrollment Manager *: Create a Python code to demonstrate the use of sets and perform set operations (union, intersection, difference) to manage student enrollments in multiple courses / appearing for multiple entrance exams like CET, JEE, NEET etc.				
7	Student Record Keeper *: Write a Python program to create, update, and manipulate a dictionary of student records, including their grades and attendance.				
8	Number Type Identifier*: Develop a Python program that takes a numerical input and identifies whether it is even or odd, utilizing conditional statements and loops.				
9	Factorial  Generator*:  Design  a  Python  program  to compute the factorial of a given integer N. built in function for link list, stack and queue.				
10	Prime Number Analyzer*: Using function, write a Python program to analyze the input number is prime or not.				
11	Simple Calculator Using Functions*: Implement a simple Python calculator that takes user input and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using functions.				
12	Extracting Words from Text File *: Develop a Python program that reads a text file and prints words of specified lengths (e.g., three, four, five, etc.) found within the file.				
13	Building an Executable File*: Create a executable file for any program developed in earlier practical.				
14	Basic Exception Handling*: Write a Python program that takes two numbers as input and performs division. Implement exception handling to manage division by zero and invalid input errors gracefully.				
15	Using a Debugger*: Demonstrate the use of a Python debugger (e.g., pdb or an IDE with debugging capabilities) on a sample program with intentional errors. Guide students on setting breakpoints, stepping through code, and examining variable values.				
16	Script to Validate Phone Number and Email ID *: Write a Python script that prompts the user to enter their phone number and email ID. It then employs Regular Expressions to verify if these inputs adhere to standard phone number and email address formats				
17	Extracting Data from Text *: Create a program that reads a text file containing various data (e.g., names, emails, phone numbers). Use regular expressions to extract specific types of data, such as email addresses, phone numbers, dates (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY format).				
18	Creating and Manipulating Arrays*: Write a Python program to create a 1D, 2D, and 3D NumPy array. Perform basic operations like reshaping, slicing, and indexing.				
19	Array Mathematics*: Develop a Python script to create two arrays of the same shape and perform element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Calculate the dot product and cross product of two vectors.				
20	Statistical Operations*: Write a Python program to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, variance, and correlation coefficients of a given array.
